Relationship to my computer: I had only gotten this Laptop last year but I am liking it more than I expected I would. Even though I prefer my ASUS Laptop to do 
more tasks, my MacBook has always been there for the wide variety of simple things I do everyday, such as making a search, finding online resources and transferring
photos. Overall, my MacBook is one of my main go to devices becuase it is smooth, efficient, and has never let me down.

Hardware to Performance: For simple tasks such as editing, school, and keeping files, this laptop is pretty efficient. But what I mostly do on Computers is run 
very intense games (sandbox games. etc) And my ASUS gaming laptop is very good at that, but not my mac. The refresh rate is bad for games, RAM is bad for games
and CPU is not the choice for games on this mac. So, as a gamer, I would have preffered more advanced hardware that can take anything. This is just not my mac.
